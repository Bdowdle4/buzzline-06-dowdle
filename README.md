P6: Implementing a Custom Streaming Pipeline

# üé∂ EDM Buzzline (Live Festival Buzz Tracker)

## Project Overview
EDM Buzzline is a real-time streaming data project that simulates audience buzz during an EDM festival.  
The pipeline uses a producer to generate messages, streams them into **Kafka**, and then uses a consumer to process the messages and extract insights and visualize trends with **Matplotlib animation**.  

The goal is to show how streaming data can be used to track *who‚Äôs trending, where the energy is, and what the crowd is most excited about* in real time.

## Project Features
- **Producer**:  
  - Generates synthetic JSON data about festival buzz (artist, stage, reaction, topic, timestamp).  
  - Streams the data into a Kafka topic (`buzzline_edm`).

Each message from the producer is a JSON object, for example:

```json
{
  "artist": "Excision",
  "stage": "Prehistoric Stage",
  "reaction": "ü¶ñ",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T20:30:15"
}
```  

- **Consumer**:  
  - Subscribes to the Kafka topic and processes incoming messages. 
  - Logs the message by appending to `edm_live.json` 
  - Tracks trending artists, stages, and audience reactions using dictionaries.  
  - Displays a **live-updating Matplotlib chart** with insights.  

- **Visualization**:  
  - **Bar Chart**: Top artist mentions in real time. 
  - **Line Chart**: Stage mentions over time.  
  - Captions and titles update dynamically (*‚ÄúExcision leading with 25 mentions‚Äù*).

### 0. If Windows, start WSL
Open a PowerShell terminal in VS Code. Run the following command:
```
wsl
```

### 1. Start Kafka
```
chmod +x scripts/prepare_kafka.sh
scripts/prepare_kafka.sh
cd ~/kafka
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/kraft/server.properties
```
**Keep this terminal open!**

In a new WSL terminal, create the topic:
```
kafka-topics --create --topic buzzline_edm --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

Verify topic was successfully created
```
bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

### 2. Run the Producer
In a new powershell terminal
```
python -m producers.edm_producer
```

### 3. Run the Consumer
In a another new powershell terminal
``` 
# Bar Chart Consumer
python -m consumers.edm_consumer
```
``` 
# Line Chart Consumer
python -m consumers.edm_consumer_line
```

You should see a live animated chart updating as new buzz messages stream in.
