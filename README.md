P6: Implementing a Custom Streaming Pipeline

# üé∂ EDM Buzzline ‚Äì Live Festival Buzz Tracker

## Project Overview
EDM Buzzline is a real-time streaming data project that simulates audience buzz during an EDM music festival.  
The system generates messages about artists, stages, and audience reactions, streams them into **Kafka**,  
and then consumes those messages to extract insights and visualize trends with **Matplotlib animation**.  

The goal is to show how streaming data can be used to track *who‚Äôs trending, where the energy is, and what the crowd is reacting to* in real time.

## Project Features
- **Producer**:  
  - Generates fake JSON data about festival buzz (artist, stage, reaction, topic, timestamp).  
  - Streams the data into a Kafka topic (`buzzline_edm`).  

- **Consumer**:  
  - Subscribes to the Kafka topic and processes incoming messages.  
  - Tracks trending artists, stages, and audience reactions using dictionaries.  
  - Displays a **live-updating Matplotlib chart** with insights.  

- **Visualization**:    
  - **Line Chart**: Stage mentions over time.  
  - Captions and titles update dynamically (*‚ÄúDJ Nova leading with 25 mentions‚Äù*). 
  - IF there is time: - **Bar Chart**: Top artist mentions in real time.
